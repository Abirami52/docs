The basic groups in the TF community
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Community At Large**: All TF users and contributors.
-  **Active Technical Contributors (ATC)**: People who have had a patch
   merged within the past 12 months. Defined in `Sections 3.2 and
   5.2.3.2.3`_ of the Community Governance document.
-  **Technical Steering Committee Approved Active Technical Contributors
   (TSC-ATC)**: People who have made technical contributions
   (participated in architectural discussions, for instance), but who
   have not had a patch merged. Defined in `Section 5.2.4.2.1`_ of the
   Community Governance document.
-  **Active Community Contributors (ACC)**: People who have made
   non-technical contributions that further the mission of TF. Defined
   in `Section 5.2.4.2.3`_ of the Community Governance document.

Groups directly involved in TF governance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Technical Project Leadership**: ATC + TSC-ATC.
-  **Technical Committee (TC)**: An elected standing committee of TF
   composed of 5 people elected out of the Technical Project Leadership.
   These people also are members of the Technical Steering Committee
   (TSC; see below). Defined in `Section 5.2.2`_ of the Community
   Governance document.
-  **Community Committee (CC)**: An elected standing committee of TF
   composed of 5 people elected out of the Community At Large. These
   people also are members of the Technical Steering Committee (TSC; see
   below). Defined in `Section 5.2.2`_ of the Community Governance
   document.
-  **Architecture Review Board (ARB)**: A nominated and TSC-confirmed
   standing committee of TF composed of 7 people from the Community At
   Large. Defined in `Section 5.2.2`_ of the Community Governance
   document.
-  **Technical Steering Committee (TSC)**: Overall leadership for the TF
   project. Composed of the entirety of the TC and CC plus one member of
   the ARB. Defined further in `Section 2`_ of the Technical Charter and
   `Section 5`_ of the Community Governance document.

Other roles
~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Project Technical Lead (PTL)**: The leader and spokesperson for a
   sub-project of TF. This is an elected postion. The PTL for a project
   is likely to be on the TSC or the ARB, but this is not a requirement
   of the position.
-  **Voting community member**: In order to vote in TF elections, a
   person must be in the ATC, TSC-ATC, or ACC, which is to say, they
   must be recognised as a contributing member of the community. This is
   defined in `Section 5.2.4.3`_ of the Community Governance document.
